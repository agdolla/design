# Icons
We use [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com) for all application icons.

Outline icons have a 2px stroke weight, and a 24x24 bounding box. This should be used for primary navigation and marketing sections, designed to be rendered at 24x24.

Solid icons have a solid fill, and a 20x20 bounding box. This should be used for buttons, form elements, and to support text, designed to be rendered at 20x20.

Here is the full set of icons included in both the `solid` and `outline` sets:
