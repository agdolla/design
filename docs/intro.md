# Introduction

For most projects, we use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com), but modified under the principles of our own design system.

The design system is designed to provide a clear, concise user experience.

This documentation consists of both design fundamentals, such as colors or icons, as well as information on all components.
