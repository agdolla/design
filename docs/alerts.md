# Alerts

Banners that draw the user's attention to an important message are called alerts. The icons and colors of an alert indicate the type and urgency of the message. Provide critical information in context with alerts to grab the user's attention.

## Placement
Alerts should appear as toasts in the bottom right of the screen. The top right of the screen may instead display alerts under certain circumstances.
